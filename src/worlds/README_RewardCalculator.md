## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { RewardCalculator } from './RewardCalculator'

// Get instance
const rewardCalculator = RewardCalculator.getInstance()

// Initialize
rewardCalculator.initialize()
```

### Calculating Quest Rewards

```typescript
// Calculate rewards for completing a quest
const questRewards = rewardCalculator.calculateQuestRewards(
  questId,
  playerId,
  playerData,
  completionTime,
  {
    difficulty: 'medium',
    timeSpent: 900, // 15 minutes
    perfectScore: true,
    firstTime: true,
    dailyStreak: 3,
    weeklyStreak: 2
  }
)

console.log('Final Experience:', questRewards.finalRewards.experience)
console.log('Final Coins:', questRewards.finalRewards.coins)
console.log('Final Orbs:', questRewards.finalRewards.orbs)
```

### Calculating Objective Rewards

```typescript
// Calculate rewards for completing an objective
const objectiveRewards = rewardCalculator.calculateObjectiveRewards(
  objectiveId,
  questId,
  playerId,
  playerData,
  {
    timeSpent: 300,
    perfectScore: true,
    location: { x: 150, y: 250, z: 0 }
  }
)
```

### Distributing Rewards

```typescript
// Distribute calculated rewards to player
const success = rewardCalculator.distributeRewards(
  questId,
  playerId,
  questRewards.finalRewards
)

if (success) {
  console.log('Rewards distributed successfully!')
}
```

### Getting Player Statistics

```typescript
// Get player reward statistics
const playerStats = rewardCalculator.getPlayerRewardStats(playerId)
if (playerStats) {
  console.log('Total Experience:', playerStats.totalExperience)
  console.log('Total Coins:', playerStats.totalCoins)
  console.log('Total Orbs:', playerStats.totalOrbs)
  console.log('Total Value:', playerStats.totalValue)
}

// Get total rewards earned
const totalRewards = rewardCalculator.getPlayerTotalRewards(playerId)
console.log('Overall Rarity:', totalRewards.rarity)
```

### Orb Conversion

```typescript
// Convert coins to orbs
const orbs = rewardCalculator.convertCoinsToOrbs(1000) // 10 orbs (at 100:1 rate)

// Convert orbs to coins
const coins = rewardCalculator.convertOrbsToCoins(5) // 500 coins (at 100:1 rate)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The Reward Calculator can be configured to enable/disable various features:

```typescript
rewardCalculator.configure({

- `questCompleted`: Automatically distributes quest rewards
- `objectiveCompleted`: Automatically calculates and distributes objective rewards

## üìà Statistics and Tracking

### Player Reward Statistics

- Total items, skills, unlockables, special rewards
- Quest and objective completion counts
- Average and highest reward values
- Last reward timestamp

### Reward History
- Complete history of all reward events
- Detailed calculation breakdowns
- Timestamp tracking for all events

## üéÆ Integration with Quest System

The Reward Calculator works seamlessly with:

- **QuestManager**: For quest lifecycle management
- **ObjectiveTracker**: For objective progress tracking
- **EventManager**: For event-driven communication
- **LevelLoader**: For quest-specific content loading

## üß™ Testing and Demonstration

Use the included test file to see the Reward Calculator in action:

```typescript
import { demonstrateRewardCalculator } from './RewardCalculator.test'

// Run the demonstration
demonstrateRewardCalculator()
```

This will show:
