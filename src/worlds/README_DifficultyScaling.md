## 📊 Configuration

### **Default Settings**

```typescript
const DEFAULT_CONFIG: AdaptiveDifficultyConfig = {
  minDifficulty: 1,           // Minimum quest difficulty
  maxDifficulty: 10,          // Maximum quest difficulty
  adjustmentThreshold: 0.1,   // Minimum change threshold
  learningRate: 0.05,         // How quickly difficulty adapts
  petIntelligenceWeight: 0.25,    // Pet AI influence on difficulty
  playerSkillWeight: 0.3,         // Player skill influence
  timeEfficiencyWeight: 0.2,      // Completion time influence

}
```

### **Customization Options**

```typescript
// Update configuration at runtime
difficultyScaling.updateConfiguration({
  learningRate: 0.1,           // Faster adaptation
  petIntelligenceWeight: 0.4,  // More pet AI influence
  playerSkillWeight: 0.2       // Less player skill influence
})
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### **Basic Integration**

```typescript
import { DifficultyScalingSystem } from './DifficultyScalingSystem'
import { QuestSystem } from './QuestSystem'
import { EventManager } from '../core/EventManager'

// Initialize systems
const eventManager = EventManager.getInstance()
const difficultyScaling = DifficultyScalingSystem.getInstance(eventManager)
const questSystem = QuestSystem.getInstance()

// Connect difficulty scaling to quest system
questSystem.initializeDifficultyScaling(difficultyScaling, eventManager)

// Create quests with automatic difficulty scaling
const quest = questSystem.createQuestWithScaling({
  title: 'Emerald Jungle Explorer',
  description: 'Venture into the mysterious jungle',
  worldId: 'emerald_jungle',
  level: 2,
  type: 'main',
  objectives: [...],
  rewards: {...}
}, 'player_123')

// Start quest with adjusted difficulty
questSystem.startQuest(quest.id, 'player_123')
```

### **Advanced Configuration**

```typescript
// Custom difficulty calculation
const customDifficulty = difficultyScaling.calculateAdjustedDifficulty(
  'quest_123', 
  'player_456'
)

// Get player performance metrics
const metrics = difficultyScaling.getPlayerMetrics('player_456')
console.log('Completion rate:', metrics.questCompletionRate)
console.log('Skill improvement:', metrics.skillImprovement)
console.log('Pet assistance:', metrics.petAssistanceEfficiency)

// Analyze difficulty adjustment history
const adjustments = difficultyScaling.getDifficultyAdjustments('quest_123')
adjustments.forEach(adj => {
  console.log(`${adj.originalDifficulty} → ${adj.adjustedDifficulty}`)
  console.log('Reasoning:', adj.reasoning.join(', '))
  console.log('Confidence:', adj.confidence)
})
```

### **Event Monitoring**

```typescript
// Listen for difficulty adjustments
eventManager.subscribe('difficultyAdjusted', (event) => {
  console.log(`Quest ${event.questId} difficulty adjusted:`)
  console.log(`  ${event.originalDifficulty} → ${event.adjustedDifficulty}`)
  console.log(`  Player: ${event.playerId}`)
  console.log(`  Factors:`, event.factors)
})

// Monitor quest performance
eventManager.subscribe('questCompleted', (event) => {
  console.log(`Quest ${event.questId} completed by ${event.player.id}`)
  // Difficulty scaling automatically updates metrics
})

eventManager.subscribe('questFailed', (event) => {
  console.log(`Quest ${event.questId} failed by ${event.player.id}`)
  // Difficulty scaling analyzes failure patterns
})
```

// Verify event manager connection
if (!questSystem.eventManager) {
  console.error('Event manager not connected')
}
```

#### **Performance Metrics Not Updating**
```typescript
// Ensure events are being emitted
eventManager.subscribe('questCompleted', (event) => {
  console.log('Quest completed event received:', event)
})

// Check player ID consistency
const metrics = difficultyScaling.getPlayerMetrics('correct_player_id')
```

#### **Configuration Not Applied**
```typescript
// Verify configuration update
const stats = difficultyScaling.getSystemStats()
console.log('Current configuration:', stats.configuration)

// Reset and reapply if needed
difficultyScaling.updateConfiguration(DEFAULT_CONFIG)
```

### **Debug Mode**

```typescript
// Enable detailed logging
difficultyScaling.updateConfiguration({
  debugMode: true,
  verboseLogging: true
})

// Monitor all difficulty adjustments
eventManager.subscribe('difficultyAdjusted', (event) => {
  console.log('🔍 Difficulty adjustment details:', {
    questId: event.questId,
    factors: event.factors,
    confidence: event.confidence,
    reasoning: event.reasoning
  })
})
```
