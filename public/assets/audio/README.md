# Audio Assets Directory

This directory is intended for game audio files.

## Required Audio Files

The following audio files are expected by the AudioSystem:

- `background-music.mp3` - Background music for the game
- `click.mp3` - Click sound effects
- `success.mp3` - Success/achievement sounds

## Current Status

**Note**: These audio files are not yet implemented. The AudioSystem has been configured to handle missing files gracefully.

## Future Implementation

When implementing audio:
1. Add the required MP3 files to this directory
2. Ensure files are properly compressed and optimized for web
3. Test audio loading and playback functionality
4. Consider implementing audio fallbacks for different browsers

## Audio System Configuration

The AudioSystem is currently configured to:
- Skip loading default audio clips when files are not available
- Log warnings instead of errors for missing files
- Continue functioning without audio for development purposes
